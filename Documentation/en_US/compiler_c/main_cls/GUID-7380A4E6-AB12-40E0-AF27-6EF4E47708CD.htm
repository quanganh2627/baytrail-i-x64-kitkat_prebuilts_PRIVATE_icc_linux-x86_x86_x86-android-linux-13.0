<h1 class="topictitle1">Cache Efficiency and Bandwidth</h1>

<div>
<p>Good cache efficiency is important for serial programs, and it
becomes even more important for parallel programs running on
multicore machines. The cores contend for bus bandwidth, limiting
how quickly data that can be transferred between memory and the
processors. Therefore, consider cache efficiency and data and
spatial locality when designing and implementing parallel programs.
For example code that considers these issues, see the  <span class="filepath">matrix</span> and  <span class="filepath">matrix_multiply</span> examples cited in <a href="GUID-F215A042-A455-403E-8BF1-B2C09E28A8A7.htm#GUID-F215A042-A455-403E-8BF1-B2C09E28A8A7">Optimize the Serial Program</a>.</p>

<p>A simple way to identify bandwidth problems is to run multiple
copies of the serial program simultaneously, one for each core on
your system. If the average running time of the serial programs is
much larger than the time of running just one copy of the program,
it is likely that the program is saturating system bandwidth. The
cause could be memory bandwidth limits or, perhaps, disk or network
I/O bandwidth limits.</p>

<p>These bandwidth performance effects are frequently
system-specific. For example, when running the  <span class="filepath">matrix</span> example on a
specific system with two cores (call it "S2C"), the "iterative
parallel" version may be considerably slower than the "iterative
sequential" version (4.431 seconds compared to 1.435 seconds). On
other systems, however, the iterative parallel version may show
nearly linear speedup when tested with as many as 16 cores and
workers. Here are the results on S2C:</p>

<pre>1) Naive, Iterative Algorithm. Sequential and Parallel.
Running Iterative Sequential version...
  Iterative Sequential version took 1.435 seconds.
Running Iterative Parallel version...
  Iterative Parallel version took 4.431 seconds.
  Parallel Speedup: 0.323855
</pre><p>There are multiple, often complex and unpredictable, reasons
that memory bandwidth is better on one system than another
(including DRAM speed, number of memory channels, cache and page
table architecture, number of CPUs on a single die). Be aware that
such effects are possible and may cause unexpected and inconsistent
performance results. This situation is inherent to parallel
programs and is not unique to Intel&reg; Cilk&#8482; Plus programs.</p>
