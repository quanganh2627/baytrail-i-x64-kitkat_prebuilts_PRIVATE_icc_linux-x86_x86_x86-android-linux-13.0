<h1 class="topictitle1">Introduction to Holders</h1>

<div>

<p> A holder is a hyperobject that isolates
parallel uses of a common variable in cases where it is not
necessary to preserve changes from different parallel strands. Each
parallel strand will see and manipulate a different view of the
holder, just as in the case of a reducer.</p>
<p>A holder is similar to
thread-local storage but is specifically designed to work with the
fork-join structure of Intel&reg; Cilk&#8482; Plus.</p>
<p>A holder has the following
characteristics:</p>
 
<p><ul type="disc" id="GUID-5029EC94-2D18-4B97-8BF4-C2B90F03A22C"><li><p>The view of a holder before the first spawn within
a function is the same as the view after each sync (as in the case
of a reducer).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The view of a holder within the first spawned
child of a function (or the first child spawned after a sync) is
the same as the view on entry to the function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The view of a holder before entering a <span class="keyword">cilk_for</span>
loop is the same as the view during the first iteration of the loop
and the view at the end of the loop.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The value stored in the view of a holder in the
continuation of a spawn or at the beginning of an arbitrary
iteration of a <span class="keyword">cilk_for</span> loop is non-deterministic. It is generally
recommended that the holder be explicitly placed into a known state
in these situations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>A holder can be used as an alternative to
parameter passing because it can replace non-local variables
without massive refactoring. A holder takes advantage of the fact
that, most of the time, a holder view does not change after a spawn
or from one iteration of a parallel for loop to the next (stealing
is the exception). When the holder view is a large object that is
expensive to construct, this optimization can save significant time
by avoiding the creation of a separate
local object for each view. </p>
<p>In addition, a holder using the "keep
last" policy has the same value after a sync as the serialization
of the same program. This characteristic often allows the program
to avoid recomputing a value.</p>
